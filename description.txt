Item Checklist lets you view a checklist for picking up or crafting 100% of the items in the game

Toggle the checklist with the hotkey assigned to it in the settings. 

The checklist has several buttons at the top. 

Cycle Found Filter: Filters the list to show All, only Found, or only missing items. 
Cycle Sort Method: Sorts the list by ID, Value, Alphabetical, Rarity, or the chest auto-sorting algorithm.
Cycle Mod Filter: Lets you filter by all items, only vanilla items, or individual mods.
Toggle Messages: Toggles the announcement chat text that happens when you pick up a new item.
Toggle Collect Chest Items: You can toggle the behavior of counting items seen in chests as "collected".

If you use Magic Storage and have the Toggle Collect Chest Items enabled, you will also collect all items in storage if you access it.
